# Nouvoice

A Next.js project leveraging Supabase for authentication.

## Building the Project

Before running the build command, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then you can build the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles the Next.js app using the scripts defined in `package.json`.
