            outdated templates.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Our Story</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Founded in 2022, Nouvoice began as a side project to solve our own
            invoicing frustrations. What started as a simple tool quickly
            evolved as we discovered how many others shared the same pain
            points. Today, we're proud to serve thousands of businesses across
            Australia and beyond, helping them streamline their financial
            operations.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8">
            Our journey is just beginning, and we're excited to continue
            building tools that give small businesses and freelancers the same
            financial capabilities as much larger enterprises.
